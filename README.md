### Abstract
The advancement in technology has made everything automatic and there is an urgent need for
all electronic and electrical devices to be smart. There is a demand for easy and fast solutions for day to day tasks. This has motivated our team to design a solution for the complaint registration system of defective electrical devices by the use of a single button click.  
  
The currently used complaint setup for defective electrical devices involves the registration of
complaints via phone calls to a particular phone number provided by the organisation to every
room. The existing system is managed manually which leads to difficulty in maintaining
regularity, resulting in the problems being left unattended and delay in fixing the devices.
Whenever a problem occurs in an electrical device, the administration must be informed
personally, following which a written complaint is filed and the maintenance staff is informed
about the issue and its location. This is a tedious and time consuming process which leads to
delay in solving the issue. To reduce the time, effort and labour, we have created an innovative
and technically enhanced idea of automated registration of complaints.  
  
Generally, the existing smart buttons perform tasks of home automation including control of
electrical appliances by button presses and importance is not given to maintenance of those
electrical appliances. Our strategy is to build a smart button which automatically registers a
complaint with the maintenance staff through a text message whose acknowledgement is
returned to the user once maintenance work is completed. This will eliminate the process of
manual registration of complaints hence making the system faster and removing the intermediate
complexity of communication via the administration. The maintenance staff will receive details of the room number and address of the complaint with the message. This idea will help not only in reducing time and manual labour for complaint registrations but also enable us to integrate our innovation with home automation in further phases of product development.
